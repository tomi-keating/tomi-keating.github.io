For years I've been searching for an comfortable place to communicate with the world, and I've tried several social platforms. However, all ended with dissatisfaction and silence. The reasons behind, I have to admit, are complicated.

This is not a good sign. Talking and sharing in today society suffer from enough rules and restriction. 

It is just not the intention of the Internet.

So I am here, as yet another attempt to re-learn the skill to speak free and re-enjoy the output of thoughts. Sincerely, I hope it will be a delightful journey.
