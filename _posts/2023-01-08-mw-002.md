[Shanghai Rainbow Chamber Singers (上海彩虹室内合唱团)](https://www.youtube.com/@rainbowchambersingers3858) is the most popular choir group in China today.

Founded by conductor Jin Chengzhi and his classmates from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, RCS began its journey in 2010 as a amateur hobby club. However, as more and more choir lovers joined RCS, it continuously enlarged its size and as of 2016, the group had 44 members from all walks of life, including professional musicians, engineers, college students and so on. 

Also in 2016, RCS got nationwide popularity because of an earwarm [*Zhang Shichao, where the hell did you put the keys to my house?(张士超你到底把我家钥匙放哪里了)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR85tjpcf34) went viral on the internet. (This is an absolute LMAO choir song especially if the audience are familiar with Shanghai. But we don't talk about this song and leave it to a future post in view of limited space.) Ever since then, RCS keeps producing high quality choir songs inheriting the essence from various cultures every year, making them even more popular in Chinese cultural circle.

In this post, I would like to recommend eight songs from the early stage of RCS, mostly 2016. I am grateful to have access to their mind-refreshing and heart-warming masterpieces in such a young age. Their songs always remind me of one thing: Life is always promising, even if I forget so.
