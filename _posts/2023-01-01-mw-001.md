[River Band (河乐队)](https://www.youtube.com/@anaismartaneriverband4201) is the best chinese folk band I have met in 2022. 

Personally, I was not a folk fan, and even considered folk as an over simplified genre since it only acquires simple (sometimes naive) composition and instrument playing. However, River Band change this stereotype.

The first song I came across is [米店 (Rice Shop)]({% link _music/米店.md %}){:target="_blank"} created by 张玮玮, a song with melancholic temperament and positive spiritual core. The splendid scenery in the MV and carefully crafted composition made this revision a true masterpiece, albeit not a hit.

Out of curiosity, I search for other songs they sing, and these songs are the best of my love:

* [Spinning Top (陀螺)]({% link _music/陀螺.md %}){:target="_blank"}. Ordinary people (e.g., me) are just spinning tops, spinning for life until the end of our life.

* [Willow Tree (秋柳)]({% link _music/秋柳.md %}){:target="_blank"}. A simple chinese nursery rhyme with complex aesthetics. I loved it since childhood.

* [I Want You (我要你)]({% link _music/我要你.md %}){:target="_blank"}. Hahah the interaction between 老狼 (the major male singer) and Anaïs is so lovely. So is the chorus by other artists in the middle of the song. :smiley:

* [Dust In The Wind (恋恋风尘)]({% link _music/恋恋风尘.md %}){:target="_blank"}. 恋恋风尘 is 老狼's first song in his first album. He was the representative of the campus folk movement back in 1980s, when he was just 20+ years old. This year, the yesterday's youth has turned into a middle-aged, this song is full of a thick flavor of regret and pity. One line, "In the age when we still believe in love, the songs I couldn't sing to you, haunted in my heart for the rest of my life", is sung so joyfully, but also so heartbreaking. If possible, I hope 恋恋风尘 will be one of the few songs that accompanies me to the end of my story.

This is it. Have a nice week!
