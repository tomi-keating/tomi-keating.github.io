夜幕低垂　心和天一样灰
As the night falls, my heart is as gray as the sky

情绪很疲惫　已容不下伤悲
Emotionally exhausted, I can no longer tolerate sadness

怎么能解开你我背后的是非
How can I unravel the right and wrong behind you and me

老朋友珍贵　失去了最可悲
Old friends are precious, losing them is the saddest

时间总会冲淡误会
Time will always dilute misunderstandings

流言却难分辨真伪
Rumors are difficult to distinguish between true and false

从渐渐消失的年岁
From the fading years

我却早已学会进退
I have already learned to advance and retreat

真心的朋友是谁
Who is my true friend

你我都能体会
You and I all know

患难时相随　流泪时安慰
Be with you in times of adversity, comfort you in times of tears

是真心　永不觉得累
Because of true heart, we never feel tired

谁也不会　在心里防备
No one will take precautions in their hearts

我愿意敞开我心扉
I want to open my heart

真情的交会
True friendship
