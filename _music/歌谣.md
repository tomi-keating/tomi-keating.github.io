站台渐渐远去 刚好下起了小雨
The platform gradually moved away, and it happened to be raining lightly

爸妈嘱咐几句 要好好照顾自己
Mom and Dad enjoined me a few words to take good care of myself

六点半的火车上 一口没喝的豆浆
On the train at 6:30, I took a sip of soy milk

行李箱牵挂的重量
The weight attached to the suitcase

经过了一段段 努力打拼的日子
After a period of days of hard work

跌倒过很多次 没有放弃这回事
I've fallen many times, but there's no such thing as giving up

小时候大人爱讲 外面的天有多大
When I was young, grown-ups loved to talk about how big the sky outside was

有一天我也要去闯
One day I'm going to take a look too

流泪和流汗我不怕
I'm not afraid of tears and sweat

家乡那儿的歌谣 对我来讲是种依靠
The ballads in my hometown are a kind of dependence for me

陪伴我多少次艰难
Accompany me to get through many hard days

彩虹多绚烂 绚烂的多平凡
How gorgeous the rainbow is, how ordinary it is

画面里那样的好看
It looks so good on the picture

家乡那儿的歌谣 对我来讲是一种好
The ballads in my hometown are a kind of comfort for me

是我最顽强的一角
Is my most tenacious corner

每一次我感到沮丧就唱起歌谣
Every time I feel down I sing a ballad

这样就会看到原来的模样
So that I can see its original face

经过了一段段 努力打拼的日子
After a period of days of hard work

跌倒过很多次 没有放弃这回事
I've fallen many times, but there's no such thing as giving up

小时候大人爱讲 外面的天有多大
When I was young, grown-ups loved to talk about how big the sky outside was

有一天我也要去闯
One day I'm going to take a look too

流泪和流汗我不怕
I'm not afraid of tears and sweat

家乡那儿的歌谣 对我来讲是种依靠
The ballads in my hometown are a kind of dependence for me

陪伴我多少次艰难
Accompany me to get through many hard days

彩虹多绚烂 绚烂的多平凡
How gorgeous the rainbow is, how ordinary it is

画面里那样的好看
It looks so good on the picture

家乡那儿的歌谣 对我来讲是一种好
The ballads in my hometown are a kind of comfort for me

是我最顽强的一角
Is my most tenacious corner

每一次我感到沮丧就唱起歌谣
Every time I feel down I sing a ballad

这样就会看到原来的模样
So that I can see its original face

每一次我感到沮丧就唱起歌谣
Every time I feel down I sing a ballad

这样就会看到原来的模样
So that I can see its original face

这样就会回到我来的地方
So that I can go back to where I come from
