电视一直闪
The TV keeps flickering

联络方式都还没删
The contact number hasn't been deleted

你待我的好
Your faith in me...

我却错手毁掉
I mistakenly destroyed

也曾一起想
We had a common wish

有个地方睡觉吃饭
A roof over our heads

可怎么去熬日夜颠倒连头款也凑不到
To make ends meet, worked day and night, couldn't even afford the downpayment

墙板被我砸烂
The wallboard I smashed

到现在还没修
Hasn't been repaired to this day.

一碗热的粥
A warm bowl of porridge

你怕我没够
Afraid I didn't have enough

都留一半带走
You gave your half.

给你形容美好今后你常常眼睛会红
To describe your goodness is to cause a future of reddened eyes

原来心疼我
Your loving ways

我那时候不懂
I didn't realise at the time.

假如我年少有为 不自卑
If I were young and promising – not inferior

懂得什么是珍贵
Knew what was precious

那些美梦
Those pipe dreams

没给你我一生有愧
That I never fulfilled for you is my shameful existence

假如我年少有为 知进退
If I were young and promising – understood proprietyh

才不会让你替我受罪
I wouldn't let you suffer for me

婚礼上 多喝几杯
At the wedding, have a few more drinks...

和你现在那位
With the one you're with

假如我年少有为 不自卑
If I were young and promising – not inferior

尝过后悔的滋味
Knew the taste of regret

金钱地位
Money and reputation

搏到了却好想退回
I have but really want to give back
