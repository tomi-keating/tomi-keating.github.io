{% highlight tex %}
Summer is gone with all its roses
Its sun and perfumes and sweet flowers
Its warm air and refreshing showers
And even autumn closes.

Yea, autumn's chilly self is going
And winter comes which is yet colder
Each day the hoar-frost waxes bolder
And the last buds cease blowing.

Summer is gone
Summer is gone
I will be seeing you.
I will be seeing you.
