明月几时有
When will the moon be clear and bright?

把酒问青天
With a cup of wine in my hand,
I ask the blue sky.

不知天上宫阙
I don’t know what season it would be

今夕是何年
in the heavens on this night.

我欲乘风归去
I’d like to ride the wind to fly home.

又恐琼楼玉宇
Yet I fear the crystal and jade mansions

高处不胜寒
are much too high and cold for me.

起舞弄清影
Dancing with my moon-lit shadow,

何似在人间
It does not seem like the human world.

转朱阁，低绮户，照无眠
The moon rounds the red mansion
Stoops to silk-pad doors,
Shines upon the sleepless,

不应有恨，何事长向别时圆
Bearing no grudge,
Why does the moon tend to be full
when people are apart?

人有悲欢离合
People may have sorrow or joy,
be near or far apart,

月有阴晴圆缺
The moon may be dim or bright,
wax or wane,

此事古难全
This has been going on
since the beginning of time.

但愿人长久
May our friendship last forever

千里共婵娟
Though far apart,
we are still able to share
the beauty of the moon together.

我欲乘风归去
I’d like to ride the wind to fly home.

又恐琼楼玉宇
Yet I fear the crystal and jade mansions

高处不胜寒
are much too high and cold for me.

起舞弄清影
Dancing with my moon-lit shadow,

何似在人间
It does not seem like the human world.

转朱阁，低绮户，照无眠
The moon rounds the red mansion
Stoops to silk-pad doors,
Shines upon the sleepless,

不应有恨，何事长向别时圆
Bearing no grudge,
Why does the moon tend to be full
when people are apart?

人有悲欢离合
People may have sorrow or joy,
be near or far apart,

月有阴晴圆缺
The moon may be dim or bright,

但愿人长久
May our friendship last forever

千里共婵娟
Though far apart,
we are still able to share
the beauty of the moon together.
