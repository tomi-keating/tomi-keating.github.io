一艘晃悠悠的船 未必能靠岸
A wobbly boat may not be able to dock

可路过它的涛澜 都成为港湾
But the waves that pass by it all become harbors

如果说漂泊是种习惯 落脚却太难
If wandering is a habit, it is just too difficult to settle down

谁能吹动它的帆 让它半路转个弯
Who can blow its sails and make it turn halfway

等的人来得姗姗 才令你期盼
The person you are waiting for comes slowly, which makes you look forward to it

如果美好都遗憾 那么谁还要完满
If all good things are regrettable, then who wants to be perfect

就让每位临时的旅伴 陪你走一段
Just let every temporary travel companion accompany you for a while

在微风拂面的傍晚 并着肩抬头看
Looking up at the windy evening

那遥远的星群像是自由的鸽子在迁徙
The distant constellations are migrating like free doves

一路上 引领着我们到另一个未知的天地
Along the way, lead us to another unknown world

于是在迷途中所有偶然间目睹的风景
So all the scenery I saw by chance in the lost way

都将 是除彼此之外无人能知晓的秘密
It will be a secret that no one can know except each other

月亮悬在那云端 多高不可攀
The moon hangs in the clouds, how unattainable

正因美好要远瞻 才没有人能独占
No one can monopolize it because beauty needs to be enjoyed from a distance

就让每位临时的旅伴 陪你走一段
Just let every temporary travel companion accompany you for a while

在微风拂面的傍晚 并着肩抬头看
Looking up at the windy evening

那遥远的星群像是自由的鸽子在迁徙
The distant constellations are migrating like free doves

一路上 引领着我们到另一个未知的天地
Along the way, lead us to another unknown world

于是在迷途中所有偶然间目睹的风景
So all the scenery I saw by chance in the lost way

都将 是除彼此之外无人能知晓的秘密
It will be a secret that no one can know except us

有些话 哪里说得清
How can I say something clearly

面对年迈的寰宇
Facing the aging universe

我们如此的年轻
We are so young

那遥远的星群像是自由的鸽子会远去
The distant constellations are like free doves going away

留下我 静静地呆立在穹隆下良久地失语
Leaving me silently standing under the dome for a long time with aphasia

等云开雾散后行囊里又多了一点回忆
After the clouds cleared and the fog cleared, there was a little more memory in the luggage

也许 所有聚散都是命运馈赠的散漫诗意
Maybe all gatherings and partings are loose poetry bestowed by fate
