大梦一场的董二千先生
Mr. Dong ErQian of the lofty dreams

推开窗户，举起望远镜
pushes open the window and raises the spyglass.

眼底映出，一阵浓烟
His eye reflects a cloud of thick smoke.

前已无通路，后不见归途
The road ahead is closed and that leading back is lost from light.
 
敌视现实，虚构远方
Resenting reality and fictionalizing the far side.

东张西望，一无所长
Gazing East and West, he finds no mastery of his own.

四体不勤，五谷不分
His limbs find no labor, he cannot differentiate the grains.

文不能测字，武不能防身
In literature, he cannot analyze words, in combat, he cannot defend hinself.

喜欢养狗，不爱洗头
He fancies raising dogs, but dislikes washing his hair.

不事劳作，一无所获
Not devoting himself to any task, he enjoys no fruition.

厌恶争执，不善言说
He despises argument and is unskilled at conversation.

终于沦为沉默的帮凶
He finds himself the accomplice of silence.

借酒浇愁，不太能喝
He seeks to quell his worries with alcohol, but finds he cannot drink.

蛊惑他人，麻醉内心
He can inspire others, but numbs his own heart.

浇上汽油，舒展眉头
Pouring on gasoline smoothes his knitted brow

纵火的青年，迫近的时间
A young pyromaniac pressed by time.
