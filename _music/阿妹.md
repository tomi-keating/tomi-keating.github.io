雀儿成一双 箸也放一双
A duo of sparrows
A pair of chopsticks

红糖水 还在沸
A pot of black sugar water
Boiling on the fire

炮竹快要放 圆眼撒春床
Bangers will shortly crackle
Longans are strewn on the wedding bed

我的阿妹 在何处
Where are you?
My dear A Mei?

老早捉迷藏 能界也捉迷藏
Why do you have to play the old game of hide and seek?

明朝阿妹要嫁人
Tomorrow you shall tie the knot

还小时候你不肯 上次问我不肯
You turned me down when we were young
And the roles were reversed last time

该日问无人回答 肯或者勿肯
The same question evokes no response today
No response definite in either way

三里路 上下天涯
The distance between us is nigh on a mile
But still it seems impassable

窗台下 又插新花
Time flows unremittingly
Another year brings another flowering season

红尘几多人 分离又谁人肯
Unnumbered people bustle in this mundane world
But dealing with departures is never a breeze

阿妹哟 阿妹哟 慢些走
O my dear A Mei
O my dear A Mei
May your pace be slow

碎银小项链 珍珠大丁香
Necklace embedded with silver grains
Pearly earrings shaped like lilacs

阿妹的手 生好兮
Exquisite and elegant are your hands

红裙配祠堂 婚纱配教堂
Donning a red dress in an ancestral shrine
Or a wedding dress in a chapel

阿妹会选哪一种
Whice choice is in your favor?

还记牢赤里膊脚在沙滩
The memory of us standing bare-foot in the sand still remains indelible

太阳落山帮你系鞋带
In which I tied your shoelaces at dusk

你说带我回家可以不可以
In which you demanded me to take you home

我说做事干最重要
I said I need to launch a career

现在我好比一只鹞 飘来飘去
But now I am like a kite drifting hither and thither

你能否能等等添
Would you wait for me a little longer?

三里路 上下天涯
The distance between us is nigh on a mile
But still it seems impassable

窗台下 又插新花
Time flows unremittingly
Another year brings another flowering season

红尘几多人 分离又谁人肯
Unnumbered people bustle in this mundane world
But dealing with departures is never a breeze

阿妹哟 阿妹哟 慢些走
O my dear A Mei
O my dear A Mei
May your pace be slow

三里路 半生天涯
The distance between us is nigh on a mile
But it took me half a lifetime to bridge over

窗台下 秋冬春夏
Time flows unremittingly, seasons come and go

红尘几多人 分离又谁人肯
Unnumbered people bustle in this mundane world
But dealing with departures is never a breeze

阿妹哟 阿妹哟 慢些走
O my dear A Mei
O my dear A Mei
May your pace be slow

阿妹哟 阿妹哟
O my dear A Mei
O my dear A Mei
