Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars?
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, darling, kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Won't you let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars?
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, darling, kiss me, kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

I love you
