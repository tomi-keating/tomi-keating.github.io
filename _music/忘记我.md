永康街上有一家牛肉面
There is a beef noodle shop on Yongkang Street

应该是西侧，我分不清东南西北
Probably on the west side
I have a bad sense of direction

你带我去过一次，后来我常去
You took me there once, and I went there often

每次让老板少放一些葱，他不听
Every time I asked the cook to put less green onions, he didn't

只好一次一次都挑出来，放进小碗
I had to pick them out one at a time and put them in a small bowl.

假装你会在一旁帮我吃掉
Pretend you will eat that for me

收到的信件堆满我的小抽屉，里面有一半是你对我的想念
The letters I received are piled up in my small drawer, and half of them are your thoughts on me

可是最近没有收到了，只有促销券跟帐单
But I haven't received any recently, only promotional coupons and bills

下个月阿K的生日，你会出现吗？
Will you show up for K's birthday next month?

本来说好要一起去的喔
Don't forget we made a deal

你会不会用我给你买的领带呢？
Will you wear the tie I bought?

相扑先生的贴纸，记得要贴在旅行箱上喔。
Mr. Sumo's sticker, remember to stick it on the suitcase

忘记我 仿佛我从未出现过
Forget me
As if I've never been there

路过我 迷失在熟悉的街头
Pass me by
Lost in the familiar streets

冲刷我 沉溺在记忆的漩涡
Wash me down
In the vortex of memory

亲吻我 如初次见面时一样
Kiss me
Like when we first met

去往你家的路上，有长长的隧道
On the way to your house, there is a long tunnel

每次都担心车灯会不会突然熄灭
Every time I worry about whether the lights will suddenly go out

总说要陪你的妈妈去旅行
I always said to travel with your mom

现在有空了
Now I'm free

现在开口还来得及吗？
Is it too late to invite now?

忘记我 仿佛我从未出现过
Forget me
As if I've never been there

忽略我 流浪在往事的霓虹
Ignore me
Wander in the neon lights of the past

拥抱我 徘徊在过往的日记
Embrace me
Hover in the diary of the past

亲吻我 如初次见面时一样
Kiss me
Like when we first met

忘记我 仿佛我从未出现过
Forget me
As if I've never been there

亲吻我 如初次见面时一样
Kiss me
Like when we first met
