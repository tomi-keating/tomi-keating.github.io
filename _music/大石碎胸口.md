渔王还想继续做渔王
The Fisher King wishes to remain the fisher King

可海港已经 不知去向
But no one knows where the harbor has gone.

此刻他醉倒 在洗浴中心
Now, he fails drunkenly into the bath house,

没有潮汐的梦中
into a dream with no tides.

胸口已暮色苍茫
His bosom is decrepit with twilight.
 
肥胖的城市 递给他一个
Tho corpulent city extends to him

传统的方法 来克制恐慌
a traditional means of conquering anxiety:

卖掉武器，风暴和喉咙
"The sale of your weapons, your gales, and your voice

换取饮食
in exchange for food and drink.

背叛能让你获得自由
Self-deceit can buy you freedom."
 
停电之后 暂时摆脱了
When the power is down

坚硬的时刻 倒转的河
the backward-flowing river of this rigid age halts for a time.

肥胖的城市
The corpulent city

驱赶着所有 拒绝沉没的人
drives a herd of people who refuse to sink,

那首疯狂的歌又响起
and that wild chantey resounds again.
 
电灯熄灭 物换星移 泥牛入海
The lights are extinguished.
Matter is transformed and the heavens have shifted.
Clay figures vanish into the sea.

黑暗好像 一颗巨石 按在胸口
The darkness is like a boulder pressing down upon the breast.

独脚大盗 百万富翁 摸爬滚打
The one-legged pirate and the millionaire fumble and grope on their bellies.

黑暗好像 一颗巨石 按在胸口
The darkness is like a boulder pressing down upon the breast.
