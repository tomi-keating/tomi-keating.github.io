没有约任何行程的早上
In the morning without any schedule

我喜欢打开每扇窗
I like to open every window

迷失在充满诱惑我的厨房
Lost in my kitchen full of temptations

我总是选择 最恬静的香
I always choose the most tranquil fragrance

昨天或许有遗憾
I may have regrets yesterday

明天可能的茫然 我不去想
Tomorrow may be at a loss, I don't think about it

看谁会紧张
Look who gets nervous

或许你会觉得寂寞叫人难以抵抗
Maybe you find loneliness overwhelming

它却带我回到最初的地方
It takes me back to where we began

AHAAHAAHAAHAAHA

流浪的人徘徊的晚上
Wandering night of the homeless

烦恼丢在回家的路上
Troubles are left on the way home

太多的赞美让我快要失去方向
Too many compliments make me lose my way

我需要安静 独自想一想
I need to be quiet and think alone

我怀疑有谁记得
I doubt anyone remembers

去年有谁得过奖 那重要吗
Does it matter who won the award last year?

我不这么想
I don't think so

或许你会说孤单叫人有点感伤
Maybe you will say that loneliness makes people feel a little sad

它带我回到最初的地方
It takes me back to where we began

AHAAHAAHAAHAAHA

回到最初我们来的地方
Back to where we came from

好多的天真被我们遗忘
A lot of innocence has been forgotten by us

你说过快乐就在这路上
You said that happiness is on the way

从不在乎结果究竟会怎样
Never caring what the outcome will be

有任何人拜访的晚上
The night anyone visits

烦恼丢在回家的路上
Troubles are left on the way home

太多的赞美让我快要失去方向
Too many compliments make me lose my way

我需要安静 独自想一想
I need to be quiet and think alone

AHAAHAAHAAHAAHA

回到最初我们来的地方
Back to where we began

好多的天真被我们遗忘
A lot of innocence has been forgotten by us

你说过快乐就在这路上
You said that happiness is on the way

从不在乎结果究竟会怎样
Never caring what the outcome will be

回到最初我们来的地方
Back to where we began

好多的天真被我们遗忘
A lot of innocence has been forgotten by us

我说过一定要互相提醒
I said we must remind each other

千万不能忘记最初的地方
Never forget where we began
