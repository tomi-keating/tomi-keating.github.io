{% highlight tex %}
傍晚六點下班
Get off work at six in the evening

換掉藥廠的衣裳
Change out of the pharmaceutical plant uniform

妻子在熬粥
The wife is boils porridge.

我去喝幾瓶啤酒
I go out to drink a few beers.

如此生活三十年
This life played for 30 years

直到大廈崩塌
Until the tower collapsed.

雲層深處的黑暗啊
A blackness deep in the clouds

淹沒心底的景觀
Has washed away the wonders of my heart.

在八角櫃檯
At the octagonal counter

瘋狂的人民商場
in crazy People's department store

用一張假鈔
Use a fake bill

買一把假槍
Buy a fake gun

保衛她的生活
Guard her life

直到大廈崩塌
until the tower collapsed.

夜幕覆蓋華北平原
Night's mask descend over the North China Plain

憂傷浸透她的臉
Sorrow saturates her face.
 
河北師大附中
In the middle school attached to Hebei Normal University

乒乓少年背向我
the ping pong boy stands with his back to me.

沉默地注視
A silent stare

無法離開的教室
A classroom one cannot exit

生活在經驗裏
Living in father's experience

直到大廈崩塌
until the tower collapsed.

一萬匹脫韁的馬
Ten thousand unbridled horses

在他腦海中奔跑
gallop through his brain.

如此生活三十年
This life played out for 30 years

直到大廈崩塌
until the tower collapsed

雲層深處的黑暗啊
Blackness deep in the clouds

淹沒心底的景觀
has washed away the wonder of my heart.
